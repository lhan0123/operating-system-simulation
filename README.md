# Introduction

This is the project of Operating System course (Fall 2020) at Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU). The project contains three parts.  

The first part is to evaluate and compare the performance of different sorting strategies and concurrency models in processing a dataset of size. The project encompasses four key tasks: (1) Implementing a Bubble Sort algorithm to sort N data elements and measuring the CPU execution time; (2) Dividing the dataset into k partitions, sorting each partition using k threads with Bubble Sort, and then merging the sorted partitions using k‚àí1 threads with Merge Sort, while measuring the CPU execution time; (3) Dividing the dataset into ùëò k partitions, sorting each partition using ùëò k processes with Bubble Sort, and then merging the sorted partitions using ùëò ‚àí 1 k‚àí1 processes with Merge Sort, while measuring the CPU execution time; and (4) Sorting the k partitions using Bubble Sort and merging them using the same process, and displaying the CPU execution time. This analysis aims to understand how different parallelism strategies and sorting algorithms impact CPU performance and efficiency.

The second part is to develop a CPU scheduling simulation program that reads process information from a file, including process ID, CPU burst time, arrival time, and priority. The program will simulate five different CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Preemptive Shortest Job First (Preemptive SJF), Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive SJF), and Priority Scheduling. For each algorithm, the program will generate and display a Gantt chart, illustrating the execution order of the processes. Additionally, it will calculate and report the turnaround time and waiting time for each process, providing a detailed comparison of the efficiency and performance of these scheduling methods.

The third part is to develop a simulation program that reads the number of page frames and the sequence of page references from a file to evaluate different page replacement algorithms. The program will simulate six page replacement algorithms: First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU), Additional Reference Bits, Second Chance, Least Frequently Used (LFU), and Most Frequently Used (MFU). For each algorithm, the program will calculate and report the number of page faults and page replacements, providing a detailed comparison of the efficiency and performance of these page replacement methods. This comprehensive analysis aims to understand how different strategies impact the effectiveness of memory management in computer systems.
